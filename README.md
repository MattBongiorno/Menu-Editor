# Menu-Editor
Menu Editor is a way for restraunts to have clean resposive web menus that are able to be edited via the web app.  This allows restraunts the ability to have an up to date online presence.  This app uses an MVC stack.

This app is a MVP.  I will continue to develop it by adding more menu classes, routes to order remotely, routes to charge for orders, a payment processor, and more.  I have neglected a polished front end to focus on funtionality for now.
